RSA algorithm

Demonstrates the steps in RSA algorithm
    You can check also the efficienty of the algorithm with the time calculation steps

    The decryption has two version:
     1, Chinese Remainder Theorem
     2, Fast Modular Exponentiation

     For testing the program with other RSA public key bit length, modify the parameter in the 28. line of the main.py

     Use only for educational purpose.
        Program was made for a College project.
        No warranty, may occur side effects.
        Program is in test phase.
        Algorithm worsk well, efficient with max 512 bit key generation
